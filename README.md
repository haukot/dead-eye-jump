# Dead Eye Jump

Emacs plugin like avy or ace-jump or EasyMotion, but with different mechanic - you select place in full frame based of quadrant of the screen.
So it'll move mechanic action without additional thinking - one place always will be the same keys.
And in 3 keys you could move(almost exactly) where you want on the screen.
